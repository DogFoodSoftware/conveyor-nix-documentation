	<h2>Provision hosts.</h2>
	<div class="p">
	  Nix isn't a provisioner, but it is an excellent tool for
	  setting up software.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Nix expressions define the package set.</li>
	    <li>Can easily include or hook into configuration as
	      packages.</li>
	    <li>Nix's dependency isolation allows the same host to be
	      provisioned for multiple purposes, even when components
	      conflict.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
      </li>
      <!-- I really want to do do:

	   <li id="Agument-build-systems">

	   It kind of works and you can even link to it and it'll show
	   up, but it messes up the 'next' arrow behavior for some
	   reason. -->
      <li>
	<h2>Augment build systems.</h2>
	<div class="p">
	  For build processes built around use make, rake, ant or similar:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Nix is all about assembling third-party and internal
	      dependencies.</li>
	    <li>Can integrate local code changes. E.g., take directory
	      or distribution tar ball as package source.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
      </li>
      <li>
	<h2>Speed builds.</h2>
	<div class="p">
	  For build systems, such as Jenkins and Bamboo:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Building multiple versions, such as development, test,
	      and production, may require blowing away and rebuilding
	      different dependency versions or packaging all
	      dependencies into each playground.</li>
	    <li>Because nix manages multiple versions, you can retain
	      different dependencies for all your branches on one host
	      and only ever need rebuild the changed code and it's
	      dependencies while still sharing everything sharable.</li>
	  </ul>

	<h2>Organize micro-distributions.</h2>

	  and their stack.
