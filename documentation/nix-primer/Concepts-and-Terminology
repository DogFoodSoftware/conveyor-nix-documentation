	<h2>It's all about derivations.</h2>
	<ul class="p">
	  <li>Installing a package builds a derivation.</li>
	  <li>A derivation is absolutely static and immutable. (Or at least it
	    should be.)</li>
	  <li>In a word, nix is a derivations factory.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

	<h2>Nix doesn't care about versions&#8230;</h2>
	<div class="p">
	  TOOD: check, but I think a 'package' refers to each version. So
	  ~/foo/1.2.nix and ~/foo/1.3.nix are two different packages.

	  Nix doesn't care about versions, but you do. So nix tries to
	  accomodate.
	  <ul>
	    <li>A package may provide one or more versions.</li>
	    <li>Each version yields an entirely distinct derivation.</li>
	    <li>Nix only really cares about 'versions' as part of the
	      package name.</li>
	    <li>Nix selects the highest version available when none
	      specified.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>

	<h2>Package delivery guaranteed.</h2>
	<ul class="p">
	  <li>Any functional change to a version specification or any input /
	    dependency yields a unique derivations.</li>
	  <li>For a given set of build inputs and a particular version
	    specification, a build should be dependently
	    repeatable.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<h2>Don't trust versions too far.</h2>
	<ul class="p">
	  <li>You can't rely on two derivations of the same package
	    version to be identical based soley on the version.</li>
	  <li>Recall that changing the package spec changes the
	    derivation.</li>
	  <li>It's ultimately the derivation where the rubber hits the
	    road. Packages and versions are merely the human-friendly
	    concepts we use to get there.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<h2>A distribution is a set of packages.</h2>
	<ul class="p">
	  <li>A distribitution is just a set of package specifications.</li>
	  <li>Source is typically retrieved by the package specification, not
	    retrieved. So even large distributions aren't very large
	    bit-wise.</li>
	</ul>
